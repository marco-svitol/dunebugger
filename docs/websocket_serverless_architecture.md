Using Azure Web PubSub as the junction point allows both the Raspberry Pi (RPI) and the web application to communicate with each other in real-time, without the need for a traditional server-client model. This setup is well-suited for scenarios where both parties need to send and receive messages.

### How It Works:
1. **WebSocket Connection**: Both the RPI and the web application establish WebSocket connections to Azure Web PubSub.
2. **Bidirectional Communication**: Once connected, both the RPI and the web application can send and receive messages through Azure Web PubSub.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: The RPI can send sensor data, status updates, or alerts to the web application, while the web application can send configuration changes or commands to the RPI.

### Example Code for RPI:
Here's an example of how you can set up the RPI to connect to Azure Web PubSub and handle bidirectional communication:

```python
import asyncio
from azure.messaging.webpubsubservice import WebPubSubServiceClient
from azure.messaging.webpubsubservice.rest import build_client

async def connect_to_webpubsub(wss_url):
    client = WebPubSubServiceClient.from_connection_string("your_connection_string")
    async with client.connect(wss_url) as websocket:
        print("Connected to Azure Web PubSub")

        # Send a message to the web application
        await websocket.send("Hello from RPI!")
        print("Message sent to the web application")

        # Handle incoming messages
        while True:
            try:
                message = await websocket.recv()
                print(f"Message received from web application: {message}")
                # Process the message or send a response
            except websockets.ConnectionClosed:
                print("Connection closed, attempting to reconnect...")
                break

async def main():
    wss_url = 'your_wss_url'
    while True:
        try:
            await connect_to_webpubsub(wss_url)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Connection error: {e}. Retrying in 5 seconds...")
            await asyncio.sleep(5)

# Run the WebSocket connection
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

### Example Code for Web Application:
Here's an example of how you can set up the web application to connect to Azure Web PubSub and handle bidirectional communication:

```javascript
const wssUrl = 'your_wss_url';

const connectToWebPubSub = async () => {
  try {
    const websocket = new WebSocket(wssUrl);

    websocket.onopen = () => {
      console.log('Connected to Azure Web PubSub');
      // Send a message to the RPI
      websocket.send('Hello from Web App!');
    };

    websocket.onmessage = (event) => {
      console.log(`Message received from RPI: ${event.data}`);
      // Process the message or send a response
    };

    websocket.onclose = () => {
      console.log('Connection closed, attempting to reconnect...');
      setTimeout(connectToWebPubSub, 5000);
    };

    websocket.onerror = (error) => {
      console.error(`WebSocket error: ${error.message}`);
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Connection error: ${error.message}. Retrying in 5 seconds...`);
    setTimeout(connectToWebPubSub, 5000);
  }
};

// Establish the WebSocket connection
connectToWebPubSub();
```

### Key Points:
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Both the RPI and the web application can send and receive messages through Azure Web PubSub.
- **Reconnection Logic**: Both examples include reconnection logic to handle connection losses.
- **Real-Time Updates**: This setup allows for real-time updates and communication between the RPI and the web application.

This design leverages the strengths of Azure Web PubSub to facilitate seamless and reliable communication between your devices.
