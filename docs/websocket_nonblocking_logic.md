Your WebSocket listener is designed to run concurrently with your main application. To achieve this, you are using both **threads** and **asyncio**. Letâ€™s break down their roles:

---

## **1. Threads in Your WebSocket Listener**
### **Why Use a Thread?**
Your main application (`main()`) has multiple tasks running (e.g., `pipe_listener.pipe_listen()`, `terminal_interpreter.terminal_listen()`). If we were to run the WebSocket listener directly within `main()`, it would block execution and prevent other tasks from running.

To solve this, we run the WebSocket listener in a **separate thread**, allowing it to run independently from the main program.

### **How It Works in Your Code**
```python
self.thread = threading.Thread(target=self.run, daemon=True)
```
- This creates a **new thread** that will execute the `run()` method.
- `daemon=True` ensures that the thread will exit when the main program terminates.

```python
def ws_connect(self):
    self.thread.start()
    print("WebSocket listener started in background thread")
```
- This starts the thread, which means `self.run()` will execute **without blocking** the main thread.

## **2. Asyncio in Your WebSocket Listener**
### **Why Use Asyncio?**
WebSockets require an **event loop** to handle messages asynchronously. Unlike normal TCP connections, a WebSocket remains **open** and **listens for messages continuously**. We donâ€™t want to block execution while waiting for new messages.

`asyncio` allows us to:
- Wait for messages **without blocking** other tasks.
- Efficiently handle multiple network I/O operations.

### **How It Works in Your Code**
```python
self.loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
```
- A new `asyncio` event loop is created for handling WebSocket connections.

```python
async def listen(self):
    async with websockets.connect(self.wss_url) as websocket:
        print("Connected to WebPubSub")
        try:
            async for message in websocket:
                print("Received message:", message)
```
- The `async with websockets.connect(self.wss_url)` establishes a **persistent WebSocket connection**.
- `async for message in websocket` keeps listening for messages **without blocking** other tasks.

```python
def run(self):
    asyncio.set_event_loop(self.loop)
    self.loop.run_until_complete(self.listen())
```
- `asyncio.set_event_loop(self.loop)`: Ensures that the new thread has its own event loop.
- `self.loop.run_until_complete(self.listen())`: Starts the WebSocket listener and keeps it running.

---

## **How They Work Together**
1. `ws_connect()` starts a **new thread**.
2. The thread calls `run()`, which starts an **asyncio event loop**.
3. The `listen()` coroutine runs inside the event loop, keeping the WebSocket connection **alive**.
4. Messages are handled **asynchronously** without blocking the main program.

---

### **Alternative Approach: Using asyncio Without Threads**
If your whole application was using `asyncio`, you wouldnâ€™t need a thread at all. Instead, you could use `asyncio.create_task()` to run the WebSocket listener in the same event loop as the rest of your application.

However, since your main program isn't fully asynchronous, the **threaded approach** is the best way to integrate WebSockets without blocking execution.
